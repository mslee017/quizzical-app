Welcome to my Quizzical App! üëã

https://dancing-alpaca-f79907.netlify.app/

This is the final solo project from [Bob Ziroll's React Course on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) developed from scratch by myself. The app selects 5 questions at random from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). The player then has to select an answer for each question and they are scored at the end with an option to play again after the game is over.

‚öíÔ∏è Built with:
* HTML
* CSS
* ReactJS

What I Learned
Mainly, the importance of "State Architecture" and really taking time to layout what each component is going to need ahead of time rather than being excited and rushing into development. I felt fairly confident when going through most of this until the end where there were some difficulties with ensuring there could be 2 different colored buttons if the user had an incorrect answer. As I look at it now, I don't think the conditional styles inside the JSX return in the Question component was really the best way to handle this, but it was what I set myself up to do with the way everything else had been constructed.
